### Prior to submitting a bug report

- **Always search the issue or pull request list first** - The odds are good that if you've found a problem, someone else has found it, too;
- **Always try the [master](https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt) branch** - to see if the reported bug has not already been fixed.
